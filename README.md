# Adaltair
This project is about Adaltair, my first virtual pet made with Arduino. He can feel your touch (literally) by capacitive sensors touch, has an 8x8 matrix led as his face and produces audio files depending on his mood. Talking about his mood, he is a bit sensitive ... every touch you trigger can change his mood, too much makes him angry, a little makes him sad, so just try to makes enough interaction with him then he will be good with you (be good little boy).
